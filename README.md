## Introduction

Multi-threaded application that searches for hairpin structures in cDNA / mRNA sequences (FASTA or GenBank) with specific consensus sequences in the loop. It implements RNAfold to predict the structure of the sequence, and UShuffle to generate random sequences with conservation of the k-nucleotide frequency.

## Requirements

JAVA Runtime 8 - Latest update. https://www.java.com/en/download/ It's highly recommended to have a multicore processor to process large sequences. This version only runs in a Windows x64 SO, because of the external executables.

## Latest releases
- 1.22 29/11/19 :
	- Fixed some issues with NCBI downloads.
- 1.20 17/10/19 : 
	- Added proxy configuration feature.

- 1.10 17/9/19 : 
	- Added FORNA structure visualization (link to webpage)
	- Added Language menu options - (English and spanish)
	- Added "Avoid lonely pairs option"
	- Fixed problems with large FASTA files ( > 50MB )

- 1.01 25/8/19 : 
	- Fixed problem with generation of multiple shuffled sequences.

## Instructions

> **Input modes**
> The File input tab allows you to select a FASTA file, or a folder containing various FASTA files to process.
> The NCBI input tab allows you to enter a list of NCBI id accession (separated by comma) to download the GenBank files from NCBI (e.g. NM_130489), the ID accession must be of a transcript sequence. The GenBank obtained will be downloaded to the destination folder.

> **Parameters**
> You must select a destination folder to save the results and the shuffled files generated and/or downloaded from NCBI.
>
>> **Shuffled sequences**
>> If you check the option to generate shuffled sequences, you must select the number of shuffled sequences to make, and the k-let parameter. 
>> The parameter k indicates the number of nucleotides that will be taken together when shuffling the sequence. The default value is k=2, this value conserves the stacking energy between bases. 
>
>> **Fold mode**
>> If you select the 'full fold' mode, the entire sequence will be processed with the RNAFold and then, the application will look for stem-loops matching the loop patterns ingresed. If you do not select the full fold mode, only one section of the entire sequence will be folded with each matching loop. This section will contain the pattern sought in the center and at the ends, two frames with the same or less number of bases as the maximum length indicated for the stem.
>
>> **Temperature**
>> Sets the folding temperature (in ºC) to RNAfold. By default 37ºC.
>
>> **Avoid lonely pairs**
>> Produce structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). ([RNAFold parameter](https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/RNAfold.1.html))
>
>> **Stem length**
>> Determines the range desired of the stem length. 
>
>> **Loop patterns**
>> Here you enter the loop patterns to find (using the IUPAC fasta nomenclature). If you enter a list, must be separated by comma.
>> *[IUPAC nucleotide codes](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html)*
>
>> **Search in anti-sense too**
>> Find the pattern ingresed in both senses.
>
>> **Find a pattern anywhere**
>> Find and additional simple pattern in the entire sequence, the output indicate the positions and number of ocurrences.

> **Output table**		
>> ***Note 1. The first columns may vary, it depends on the anotations in the FASTA files.***
>> ***Actually is able to parse Ensembl, FlyBase, GenBank and BIOMart headers. Each of these formats have different initial columns.***
